host starts.

client establishes a socket connection to the ip address accepted.

host gets client's ip address and ends the connection.

client makes 2 objects:
local client 
online host

server makes 2 objects:
local host
online client

local client is ready to accept a socket connection from the server  (from doHandShakeWith() method)
through a Networks object.
meaning that the server's client object makes a socket connection to a port in client's ip
and that connection is received by a Networks object, which is then linked to the local player (Human) 
object of the client.


online host is ready to accept a socket connection from the server  (from doHandShakeWith() method)
